## Background
Agri-food systems account for one-third of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Crippa et al., 2021; Tubiello et al., 2021). They are generated within the farm gate, by crop 
activities; by land-use change, for instancforest land and peatland drainage to make room for agriculture; and in pre- and post-production processes, such as food  manufacturing, retail,    household consumption and food disposal (Tubiello et al., 2022). 
## Problem Statement 
The agri-food system contributes significantly to global CO2 emissions, with variations across countries due to diverse agricultural practices, land use patterns, and levels of industrialization. Therefore,understanding country-specific emissions within the agri-food system is essential for targeted mitigation strategies and policy interventions. The objective of this project is to utilize Power BI to conduct a comprehensive analysis  of CO2 emissions in the agri-food system, focusing on individual countries. The analysis aims to: 
- Collect, clean and integrate relevant data sources from Kaggle Dataset to quantify CO2 emissions associated with agricultural activities, food processing, transportation, and consumption patterns for each country. 
- Visualize and compare CO2 emissions across different stages of the agri-food supply chain within and between countries. 
- Identify key drivers of CO2 emissions in the agri-food system for each country, including agricultural practices, land use changes, and dietary preferences.
- Develop interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to facilitate data exploration, trend analysis, and scenario planning for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders.

## Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Agri-Food_data.csv from Kaggle dataset
## Analysis Highlight:
In 2020, global agri-food systems emissions were 18.43M tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2eq), an increase of 11 percent since 2000 and down 1 percent from 2019.
The share of agri-food systems in total emissions in 2020 (31 percent) confirmed the steady downward trend from the levels of 2000 (38 percent), a consequence of agri-food systems emissions growing significantly more slowly than the rest of the economy, dominated by fossil fuels combustion for energy use. 
- In 2020 the top 5 countries of Agri-food system emitters are China, China, Mainland, USA, India and Brazil and Bottom 5 are Chile, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and Finland 
- Out of the total 21 Agri-food system emission drivers the top 5 are IPPU (Emissions from industrial processes and product use), Net forest conversion, HH consumption, Rice cultivation and food processing 
- In conclusion, the global agri-food system emission trends are increasing since 1990, due to this fact all actors in the development landscape should give emphasis in this sector to mitigate the impact of the agricultural VC on GHGs emission
